        <h2 id="my_family" style="color: var(--primary-color);">My family</h2>
        <p>I come from a big and supportive family that consists of 5 members. Family is a very important part of my life. I am the older sibling. My sister is two years younger than me, and she is studying to get accepted to ATU. Even now, although we’re both busy with school, we still support each other with our exams and talk about our goals and plans. My brother, however, is 14 years younger, and goes to kindergarten. My parents also play a big role in my life. They’ve always encouraged me to study hard, stay focused, and follow my ambitions. Their support helps me stay motivated, especially when the exam pressure gets intense. My mother is a housewife and dad works at BP company.</p>

        <h2 id="education" style="color: var(--primary-color);">Education</h2>
        <p>I am currently a first-year student at ADA University, majoring in Mathematics. During my school years, I participated in various competitions and received diplomas, medals, and gifts for my achievements. Now I am mainly focused on passing the University courses. Though it is very hard and challanging, after every failure I am trying to get up and check other new methods of studying. I enjoy organizing things — my notes, study plans, and even my daily schedule. I like watching educational videos, learning new strategies for studying, and finding ways to understand difficult subjects more easily. I also enjoy reading short articles, exploring interesting topics online, and sometimes practicing English through videos or exercises.</p>

        <h2 id="my_hobbies" style="color: var(--primary-color);">My hobbies</h2>
        <p>My hobbies are solving math problems, doing sport, swimming, drawing, and reading books. Mostly in my free times I prefer drawing or painting, whenever. Every birthday or on any other event my closest people buy me new painting tools and it makes me happy. I enjoy spending my free time engaging in these activities as they help me relax and develop new skills. I got 1st place in an art competition at school when I was 12.</p>

        <h2 id="my_goals" style="color: var(--primary-color);">My goals</h2>
        <p>My short-term goal is to excel in my current studies and gain a deeper understanding of mathematics. In the long term, I aspire to pursue a career in a field that allows me to apply mathematical concepts to solve real-world problems. I want to start my own way of teaching, and maybe create my own business. Because I cannot agree with the most of courses' education program, teaching methods are not always effective for me, so I want to create a better system for myself and others.</p>
